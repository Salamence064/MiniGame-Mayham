Documentation for trickshot .map files.
Note: if any of this is not followed, undefined behvior will occur when parsing your map.

1st line = width
2nd line = height
3rd line = number of wall colliders
4th line = number of boost panel colliders
5th line = number of sand colliders
6th line = number of water colliders

Place tiles in a width by height grid according to the following legend:
    w = wall
    b = ball
    h = hole
    B = boost panel
    s = sand
    W = water
    anything else = nothing

The remaining lines should be the starting and ending points of your colliders.
They should be formatted: x1,y1|x2,y2 (e.g. 16,32|32,48)
The wall colliders should be placed first, then the boost panel colliders, then the sand colliders, then, finally, the water colliders.
If they are placed out of order or you say there will be more colliders than you specify, undefined behvior will occur.
